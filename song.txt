My money don't jiggle, jiggle, it folds
I'd like to see you wiggle, wiggle, for sure
It makes me wanna dribble, dribble, you know
Riding in my Fiat
You really have to see it
Six feet two in a compact
No slack but luckily the seats go back
I've got a knack to relax, in my mind
Sipping some red, red wine
